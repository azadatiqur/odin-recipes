        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>There are MANY reasons that I think this <strong>skillet lasagna</strong> is the best but my favorite one is… You cook it all in one pan! This not only makes the cooking part easy but cleanup is a breeze! Using just a skillet, you combine all of the ingredients together and cook them up! The flavor is soaked up and you get to taste just how delicious this combination of spices and ingredients is! I love it so much and want you to try it out too!

            This recipe is simple and quick. It only takes about 30 minutes from start to finish! This means that this is a meal that you can whip up after a long day and not spend the whole evening cooking! In fact, try making this homemade marinara sauce ahead of time. That will make this recipe even easier…if that’s possible! You can toss this salad while your skillet lasagna is cooking and your meal will be ready in no time. I know that you will love this recipe!
